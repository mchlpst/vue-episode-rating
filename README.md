# NN Game of Thrones

At NN we love game of thrones so there for the PO decided we need a good overview of all available episodes in each season.
In order to facilitate this your team mate created an API that can be used to return seasons and episodes of Game of Thrones.
The PO would like the application to look like the result as can be seen in readme-final-result.png.

The application has the following requirements
- When clicking a season checkbox it should show the episodes available in that season
- The PO wants a star indication for each episode based on the imdb rating.
- Accessibility is very important so instead of clicking on the checkbox the PO would also like be accessible via keyboard.

The PO also mentioned that the server costs should be limited so if you can limit the amount of API calls that would be great.
